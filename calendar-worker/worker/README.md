# Calendar Worker - Refactored Structure

This directory contains the refactored calendar worker application, organized into a modular structure for better maintainability and scalability.

## Directory Structure

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Routes**: Each API endpoint group has its own file
- **Services**: Business logic separated from route handlers
- **Middleware**: Reusable error handling and CORS configuration
- **Types**: Centralized type definitions

### 2. **Reduced Main File Size**
- **Before**: 613 lines in `index.ts`
- **After**: ~50 lines in `index.ts`
- **Reduction**: ~92% reduction in main file size

### 3. **Better Maintainability**
- Easy to find specific functionality
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Simplified testing and debugging
- Reduced merge conflicts

### 4. **Improved Code Quality**
- Centralized error handling
- Consistent response patterns
- Reusable utility functions
- Better type safety

## Usage

### Adding New Routes
1. Create a new route file in `routes/`
2. Export the router
3. Import and mount in `index.ts`

### Adding New Services
1. Create a new service file in `services/`
2. Implement business logic
3. Import and use in route handlers

### Error Handling
Use the centralized error handling utilities:
```typescript
import { createErrorResponse, createSuccessResponse } from '../middleware/error-handler';

// For errors
return createErrorResponse(c, 'Error message', 400);

// For success
return createSuccessResponse(c, { data: result }, 201);
```

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Each file has a single, clear purpose
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without cluttering main file
- **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Readability**: Much easier to understand what each part does
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously

## Migration Notes

The refactoring maintains 100% backward compatibility - all existing API endpoints work exactly the same way. The changes are purely structural and internal.
